# RPG_Game_unity
** This game / project is still being worked on **
Unity learning project where i am trying to make an rpg game.
This is done using C# for the coding and unity as the game engine.
I've uploaded just the code files since there are to many files to upload.
i'll add some screenshots of the folders so you can get a feel of the layout and structure.
